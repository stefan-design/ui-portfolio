     <h4>About</h4>
     <p>Hello there, glad to see you here I’m Stefan Savanovic a Serbian freelance designer, currently living in Novi Sad, Serbia.
        I create amazing user interfaces, help people define their brand, and appreciate
        polished user experience. With few more skills up my sleeves, I am always ready to crystallize your digital product.  My creative journey started around 8 years ago while I studied graphic design. At the time I was working on conventional graphic design projects but moved on to the world of branding and the digital world after just a year and a half.  Since then I have had a chance to master my UI design skills, as well as Branding and UX research skills, and become a valuable asset on many successful projects I was happy to work on.</p>

    <h4>My Passion</h4>
    <p>Passionate, Calm, Natural, Creative, Nature Lover are the words that can describe me, and I just love being every one of them. Having a job that you love feels great, but loving every single thing that you do each day makes living even better. And that is the life I’m living, and the life I’m enjoying. I’m also actively working as a film photographer. I do it as part of a photography duo called<a href=""> FOURTH </a>, which is created by me and my beautiful girlfriend Lenka. Her love is another reason my life is a living paradise.</p>

<div class="first">
    <p>For me, life is always worth it, and the secret for feeling that was is simple. It’s all hidden in healthy honest smiles and small things that make them. The small things that combine all the things I love, the thing that can teach you how to find that happiness in little details such as breathing each breath, walking each step, taking care of a plant, just simply living.</p>
